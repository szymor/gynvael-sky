# .S.k.y. by gynvael.coldwind//vx

## description
This repository contains the source code of .S.k.y. demo effect by gynvael.coldwind//vx. If you want to know more about the algorithm, read [the article](https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?id=90).

The demo was ported by me (i.e. vamastah) for Bittboy and compatibles.

## how to use
Well, you just need to run the demo and watch. The first launch takes a long time (~1 minute), because a normal map needs to be precalculated.

You can use a directional pad to move the light manually. Press START to see a FPS (frames per second) counter.
